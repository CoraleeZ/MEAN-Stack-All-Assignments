    <h1>ninja information</h1>
    <p>A ninja (忍者) or shinobi (忍び) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan. The functions of a ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare.[1] Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed
        dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai.[2] Though shinobi proper, as specially trained spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period (15th–17th centuries),[3] antecedents may have existed as early as
        the 12th century.</p>
